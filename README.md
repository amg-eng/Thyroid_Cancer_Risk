## Introduction
The objective of this study was to train machine learning models to predict the likelihood of recurrence in patients diagnosed with well-differentiated thyroid cancer. Given the importance of accurate risk prediction in guiding patient management and follow-ups, this project seeks to improve prediction accuracy using ensemble learning techniques.

## Data Description
The dataset includes clinical and pathological features of 383 patients diagnosed with well-differentiated thyroid cancer over a 15-year period, with a minimum follow-up of 10 years. Key features include:
- Age
- Gender
- Smoking history
- Radiotherapy history
- Thyroid function
- Physical examination results
- Pathology
- Tumor focality
- ATA risk assessment
- TNM staging
- Initial treatment response
- Recurrence status

## Preprocessing
1. **Duplicate Removal**: Removed 19 duplicate records.
2. **Label Encoding**: Transformed categorical variables into numerical values.
3. **Feature Selection**: Selected features highly correlated with the target variable using a correlation matrix.

## Models Implemented
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **Decision Tree (DT)**
- **Random Forest (RF)**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)**

## Ensemble Method
The ensemble model combines predictions from multiple base models using:
- **Voting Classifier**: Aggregates predictions via majority voting.
- **Stacking Classifier**: Uses a meta-model to combine base model predictions for enhanced accuracy.

## Results
The ensemble model achieved the highest accuracy compared to individual models, effectively enhancing risk stratification for recurrence prediction. Key performance metrics include sensitivity, specificity, AUC, and accuracy.

## Conclusion
The project demonstrates the potential of ensemble learning in predicting thyroid cancer recurrence. The ensemble model outperformed individual models, providing a more accurate tool for clinical decision-making and personalized treatment planning.
